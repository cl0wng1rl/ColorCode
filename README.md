# ColorCode

**A VS Code extension that can generate color themes for your workspace!** ColorCode is powered by [Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) which means themes are randomly generated by a sophisticated algorithm. ColorCode gives you infinitely many themes so you can find the perfect theme for you with just one extension. If you find a theme you like you can save it too. Colormind.io changes the source material for their generator every day so themes will continue to have a different feel to them.
