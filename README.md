# ColorCode README

ColorCode is VS Code extension that can generate color themes for your workspace. It is powered by Colormind.io which means themes are intelligently generated. ColorCode gives you infinitely many themes so you can find the perfect theme for you with just one extension. If you find a theme you like you can save it too. Colormind changes the source material for their generator every day so themes will continue to have a different feel to them.
