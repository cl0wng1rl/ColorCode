# ColorCode

**A VS Code extension that can generate color themes for your workspace!** ColorCode is powered by [Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) which means themes are randomly generated by a sophisticated algorithm. ColorCode gives you infinitely many themes so you can find the perfect theme for you with just one extension. If you find a theme you like you can save it too. Colormind.io changes the source material for their generator every day so themes will continue to have a different feel to them.

Save your theme by running the command 'ColorCode: Save Current Theme' and giving your theme a name.

Load a theme by running the command 'ColorCode: Load Theme' and supplying the name of a saved theme.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of ColorCode

## Misc

This is my first VS Code extension, so if you find that there are issues with ColorCode then please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/gabrielbarker/colorcode/issues)! I'm certain there will be things I missed.

Any relevant changes for each version are documented in the changelog. Please update and check the changelog before filing any issues, as they may have already been taken care of.

This extension will undoubtably produce less thorough and well balanced themes as the many exceptional themes on VS Code. It is intended as a solution to the problem of growing tired of a theme and wanting to freshen up your workspace, without finding and installing a new theme. I hope it brings some color to your development!

Special thanks to Beth Williamson for the awesome logo design!
